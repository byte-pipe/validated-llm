    1. Batch Conversion (Priority: High)

    Since we've completed the template library and enhanced JSON schema detection, the next logical step is implementing batch conversion functionality for the prompt-to-task
    tool. This would include:

    - Process multiple prompt files at once
    - Batch configuration for common settings
    - Progress reporting for large batches
    - Parallel processing for better performance
    - Summary reporting of conversions
