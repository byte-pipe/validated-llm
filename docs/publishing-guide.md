# Publishing Guide

This document outlines the process for publishing the validated-llm package to PyPI.

## Pre-Publishing Checklist

### 1. Package Name Verification
- âœ… Check name availability on PyPI using `poetry search <package-name>`
- âœ… Current name `validated-llm` is available
- ðŸ¤” Consider renaming to `self-correcting-llm` to better reflect the architectural innovation

### 2. Package Configuration
Ensure `pyproject.toml` has correct metadata:
- Package name and version
- Author information and email
- Description and keywords
- License (currently MIT)
- Python version requirements (^3.11)

### 3. Dependencies
- âœ… All dependencies are standard PyPI packages
- âœ… No local path dependencies (chatbot dependency removed)
- Core dependencies: `openai`, `pydantic`, `pyyaml`, `jsonschema`

### 4. Code Quality
- âœ… All tests passing: `poetry run pytest`
- âœ… Type checking: `poetry run mypy .`
- âœ… Code formatting: `poetry run black .`
- âœ… Import sorting: `poetry run isort .`
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks passing

## Publishing Process

### Step 1: Setup PyPI Account
1. Create account at [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/account/register/)
2. Enable 2FA for security
3. Generate API token at [PyPI API tokens](https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)
4. Configure Poetry with token:
   ```bash
   poetry config pypi-token.pypi your-api-token-here
   ```

### Step 2: Build Package
```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/

# Build package
poetry build

# Verify build artifacts
ls dist/
# Should show: package-name-version.tar.gz and package-name-version-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Step 3: Test on TestPyPI (Recommended)
```bash
# Configure TestPyPI repository
poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

# Publish to TestPyPI first
poetry publish -r testpypi

# Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ validated-llm
```

### Step 4: Publish to PyPI
```bash
# Publish to real PyPI
poetry publish

# Verify publication
# Package should be available at https://pypi.org/project/validated-llm/
```

### Step 5: Post-Publication
1. Create GitHub release matching the version tag
2. Update documentation with installation instructions
3. Announce on relevant communities (Reddit, HackerNews, etc.)

## Package Name Considerations

Based on the architectural patterns analysis, consider these names:

| Name | Positioning | Market Fit |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `validated-llm` | Generic validation library | Crowded space |
| `self-correcting-llm` | Novel self-correction pattern | Unique positioning |
| `reliable-llm` | Focus on reliability | Clear user benefit |
| `corrective-llm` | Corrective feedback approach | Specific to method |

### Recommendation: `self-correcting-llm`
- Matches the novel "Self-Correcting AI Proxy" pattern
- Differentiates from generic validation libraries
- Positions as solving reliability through self-correction
- Clear technical innovation story

## Version Management

Follow semantic versioning:
- `0.1.x` - Initial alpha releases
- `0.x.0` - Minor feature additions
- `1.0.0` - First stable release
- `x.0.0` - Breaking changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check API token configuration
- **403 Forbidden**: Package name might be taken or reserved
- **File already exists**: Version already published, increment version number
- **Invalid distribution**: Check package structure and metadata

### Build Issues
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
poetry cache clear --all pypi
rm -rf dist/ __pycache__/
poetry install
poetry build
```

## Marketing Strategy

### Target Audience
1. **AI/ML Engineers** building production LLM applications
2. **Backend Developers** needing reliable AI integration
3. **Companies** wanting validated LLM outputs for business logic
4. **Researchers** working on LLM reliability

### Key Messaging
- "Transform unreliable LLM outputs into production-ready results"
- "Self-correcting AI with automatic retry and feedback loops"
- "Enterprise-grade validation for language model applications"
- "Reliability patterns for AI systems"

### Launch Channels
- GitHub README with clear examples
- Technical blog post on architecture patterns
- Reddit: r/MachineLearning, r/Python, r/LLMDevs
- HackerNews technical deep-dive
- Python Package Index featured packages
- AI/ML newsletters and communities
