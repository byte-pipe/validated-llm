# Validated LLM - Library Notes

## Overview
A clean, elegant solution for getting reliable structured output from LLMs through validation and retry loops.

## Key Features

### What makes it clever:
1. **Automatic Retry Logic** - Handles retries automatically when LLM output doesn't validate
2. **Structured Interface** - Clean API with prompt template, validator, input data, and retry config
3. **Rich Result Object** - Returns success, output, attempts, execution time, validation results, and debug info
4. **Smart Feedback Loop** - Feeds validation errors back to LLM for corrections
5. **Debug Support** - Can save execution logs showing full conversation between LLM and validator

### Why it's useful:
- **Reliability** - Guaranteed valid output instead of hoping LLM gets it right
- **Transparency** - Shows exactly how many attempts and what went wrong
- **Debugging** - Detailed logs of entire process when things fail
- **Flexibility** - Plug in any custom validator for specific format/requirements
- **Performance** - Tracks timing and attempt metrics

## Comparison to Existing Solutions

### Similar concepts:
1. **Guidance/LMQL/Jsonformer** - Token-level constraints during generation (different approach)
2. **LangChain Output Parsers** - Basic retry logic but not as structured
3. **Instructor** - Pydantic validation with retries but tied to OpenAI function calling
4. **Guardrails AI** - Similar validation concept but heavyweight, focused on safety/compliance

### What makes this unique:
1. **Clean separation of concerns** - Validator independent from LLM interaction
2. **Framework agnostic** - Works with any LLM vendor (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
3. **Flexible validation** - Not tied to specific schema format
4. **Comprehensive debugging** - Well-designed execution logs and attempt tracking
5. **Simple API** - Just `execute()` with template, validator, and data

## Usage Example

```python
# Clean and simple
result = validation_loop.execute(
    prompt_template=template,
    validator=custom_validator,
    input_data=data,
    max_retries=3
)

# Result contains:
# - success: bool
# - output: validated LLM output
# - attempts: number of tries
# - execution_time: performance metric
# - validation_result: detailed feedback
# - debug_info: troubleshooting logs
```

## Value Proposition
Turns unreliable LLM output into a reliable API call with guaranteed valid structured data. The validation loop abstracts away complexity of prompt engineering for retries, error handling, and feedback incorporation.

## Open Source Potential
This fills a real gap - a simple, elegant way to get reliable structured output from LLMs. The vendor-agnostic nature and great debugging support make it especially valuable for the community.

### TODO for Open Source Release:
- [ ] Extract from current codebase
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Create examples for common use cases
- [ ] Add tests for different LLM vendors
- [ ] Consider plugin system for validators
- [ ] Benchmark performance across providers
- [ ] Create comparison table with alternatives
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
